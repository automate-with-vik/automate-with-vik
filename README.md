## 👋 Hi, I'm Vikrant Shinde

🚀 **Network Engineer | Transitioning into Network Automation**

Welcome to my GitHub! 
I am a Network Engineering Consultant specializing in optimizing network performance, driving automation, and deploying scalable infrastructure. Experienced with wireless and fiber technologies, performance testing tools like OctoScope, IXIA IxLoad, and TRex, and skilled in advanced troubleshooting. Proficient in Python and Linux shell scripting, with hands-on experience configuring enterprise-grade Dell and HPE server hardware. Skilled in test planning, functional and end-to-end validation, and thorough root cause analysis. Currently, I am focused on enhancing my capabilities in network automation, CI/CD workflow implementation, and next-generation firewall technologies to design resilient and future-ready network environments.
